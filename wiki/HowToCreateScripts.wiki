#summary This will teach you how to create new scripts

= Introduction =

The API is almost the same as RSBot/powerbot. This guide will be finished later


= Details =

To start, you will need to go to your script dir. Before doing anything, run the bot atleast once so the directory structure is made.
On Windows, this is done by going to run -> %APPDATA% -> bsbot
On Linux or Mac, this is done by going to your home directory -> bsbot

You will need to get the latest version of the bot .jar, copy it to the directory 'jar' and rename it to BSBot.jar

After that, you will need to write a script, here are some examples:
